                            Our origin into renting personal watercraft began in the Spring of 1994, when Shawn started SK Jet Ski Rentals renting two personal watercraft to his
                            fraternity at Oregon State University. The business grew from just one fraternity to include many fraternities of both Oregon State and U of O, and
                            then onto the general public. Our fleet went from two, to six, to eleven, to seventeen, into the mid-thirtyâ€™s! By 1998, we were the largest rental
                            operation in the State of Oregon with three locations around the Portland Area (Columbia River, Hagg Lake, and Wilsonville).

                            SK Watercraft Rentals, Inc. is the business name today, is still renting personal watercraft on the Columbia River just as we did in the mid-1990's.
                            But now we have added to our services with rentals of 21ft Ski Boats, Pontoon Boats, Fishing Boats, Can-am Spyder Roadster, and Segway Rentals along
                            the Portland Waterfront.  In the winter we rent Ski-doo Snowmobiles.  We offer many recreational activities to enjoy the outdoors here in Oregon.
